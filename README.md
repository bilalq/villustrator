Villustrator
============

[![Travis Badge][TravisBadge]][Travis]

This is a GUI for creating Vim colorschemes right in the browser.

This was made during the PennApps Spring 2012 hackathon.

~~Initially, I planned on improving it, but my creation of this inspired
someone far more learned and skilled than me to create a better variation.
See http://bytefluent.com/vivify if you're interested.~~

This project is now being revived. I am imagining a tool targeted more towards
CLI Vim colorschemes.

The goal is to do a total rewrite in Angular using literate CoffeeScript and
have it run as a purely static single-page-app.
